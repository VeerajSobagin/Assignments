    "### 1. Explain the basic architecture of RNN cell.\n",
    "The basic architecture of an RNN cell involves taking input from the previous state and the current input, performing a matrix multiplication and applying a non-linear activation function, and producing an output and passing it on to the next state. The output of each state is dependent on the current input and the previous state. The output can be used for prediction or passed on as input to the next state."

    "Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is a technique used for training RNNs. It involves unrolling the RNN over time and applying the backpropagation algorithm to calculate gradients and update the weights. The process involves calculating the error at each time step and propagating it backward through time, using the chain rule to compute the gradients and updating the weights accordingly."

    "### 3. Explain Vanishing and exploding gradients\n",
    "Vanishing and exploding gradients are problems that can occur when training RNNs. Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients become too small to be useful for training, while exploding gradients occur when the gradients become too large and cause the training to diverge. These problems arise because the gradients are calculated by multiplying the weight matrix at each time step, which can cause the gradients to shrink or grow exponentially over time."

    "### 4. Explain Long short-term memory (LSTM)\n",
    "Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and to capture long-term dependencies in sequences. It uses special memory cells that allow the network to selectively remember or forget information at each time step, and gate units that regulate the flow of information. The LSTM cell has three main components: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate, which control the flow of information into and out of the cell."

    "Gated recurrent unit (GRU) is another RNN architecture that is similar to LSTM, but with fewer parameters. It uses a gating mechanism to control the flow of information, but only has two gates: the update gate and the reset gate. The update gate controls how much information to keep from the previous state, while the reset gate determines how much to ignore from the current input."

This allows the network to capture both past and future context for each time step, and can lead to better performance on certain tasks, such as speech recognition."

    "Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is a variant of the popular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). BiLSTM is capable of processing input sequences in both forward and backward directions, allowing it to capture both past and future context for each time step. This makes it particularly well-suited for tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and time series prediction.\n",

    "In BiLSTM, the network is divided into two parts: a forward LSTM and a backward LSTM. Each LSTM cell has three gates: an input gate, a forget gate, and an output gate, which allow the network to selectively control the flow of information through the cell. The forward and backward LSTMs each have their own set of parameters, which are learned independently during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, BiLSTM processes the input sequence in both directions, producing two sets of hidden states that are concatenated at each time step. This concatenated output is then fed into a fully connected layer for prediction.\n",
