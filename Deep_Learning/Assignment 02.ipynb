    "### 1. Describe the structure of an artificial neuron. How is it similar to a biological neuron? What are its main components?\n",
    "An artificial neuron, also known as a perceptron, is a computational unit that takes in several inputs, processes them, and produces an output. It consists of three main components: inputs, weights, and an activation function. The inputs are weighted, and then the sum is passed through an activation function to produce the output. This is similar to how a biological neuron receives and processes inputs through dendrites, and sends out an output signal through an axon. However, artificial neurons are much simpler in structure than biological neurons."

    "There are several activation functions commonly used in artificial neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid function: The sigmoid function produces a smooth S-shaped curve and maps any input value to a range between 0 and 1. It is commonly used in the output layer of binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU function: The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function sets all negative inputs to zero and maps all positive inputs to their own value. It is the most commonly used activation function in deep learning models because it is computationally efficient and does not suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanh function: The tanh function is similar to the sigmoid function but maps inputs to a range between -1 and 1. It is commonly used in the hidden layers of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax function: The softmax function is used in the output layer of multi-class classification problems. It maps inputs to a probability distribution over multiple output classes, ensuring that the sum of the probabilities adds up to 1."
