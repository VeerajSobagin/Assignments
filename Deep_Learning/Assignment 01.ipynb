    "The summation junction of a neuron receives input signals from other neurons or environmental factors and computes the weighted sum of these inputs to determine whether to activate the neuron or not. The threshold activation function is a function that determines whether a neuron will fire or not based on the input signal it receives."

    "A step function is a function that maps all input values below a certain threshold to one value and all input values above that threshold to another value. The difference between a step function and a threshold function is that a step function has a discontinuity at the threshold while a threshold function can have a smooth transition."

The dendrites receive inputs, and the axon transmits outputs to other neurons or muscles. When inputs are strong enough, the neuron fires an action potential, which is a brief electrical signal that propagates along the axon.\n",

The function is computationally efficient, easy to optimize, and can avoid the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks. ReLU has been successful in many applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing."
