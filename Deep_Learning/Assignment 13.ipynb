    "### 1. Why is it generally preferable to use a Logistic Regression classifier rather than a classical Perceptron (i.e., a single layer of linear threshold units trained using the Perceptron training algorithm)? How can you tweak a Perceptron to make it equivalent to a Logistic Regression classifier?\n",
    "Logistic Regression is generally preferable to a classical Perceptron because it can output class probabilities and handle non-linearly separable data through the use of a logistic activation function. To make a Perceptron equivalent to a Logistic Regression classifier, you can replace the step activation function with a logistic function and use gradient descent to minimize the cross-entropy loss."

    "### 2. Why was the logistic activation function a key ingredient in training the first MLPs?\n",
    "The logistic activation function was a key ingredient in training the first MLPs because it allowed for non-linear transformations of the input data and smooth gradients that made backpropagation feasible. The logistic function is also differentiable, allowing for the use of gradient descent optimization."

    "### 3. Name three popular activation functions. Can you draw them?\n",
    "Three popular activation functions are the sigmoid function, ReLU (rectified linear unit) function, and tanh (hyperbolic tangent) function. The sigmoid function is a smooth S-shaped curve that outputs values between 0 and 1. ReLU is a piecewise linear function that outputs 0 for negative inputs and the input itself for positive inputs. tanh is similar to sigmoid, but outputs values between -1 and 1."

    "Backpropagation is an algorithm used to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights in a neural network. It works by recursively applying the chain rule of calculus to compute the derivatives of the output with respect to each weight. Reverse-mode autodiff is a more general technique used to calculate gradients of arbitrary functions, but it is equivalent to backpropagation in neural networks."
