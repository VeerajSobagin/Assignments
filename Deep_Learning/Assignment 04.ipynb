    "TensorFlow is a popular open-source Deep Learning library that offers various tools and features for developing, training, and deploying machine learning models. Its main features include a flexible architecture, efficient data processing, and distributed computing capabilities. Other popular Deep Learning libraries include PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe."

    "TensorFlow is not a drop-in replacement for NumPy, as it offers more advanced features for developing and training machine learning models. While both libraries offer similar functionalities for handling numerical data, TensorFlow is specifically designed for building and training complex machine learning models, whereas NumPy is a general-purpose numerical computing library."

    "Dynamic Keras models are required when the architecture of the model depends on the input data, such as in recurrent neural networks or models with variable-length inputs. Dynamic models can be created using the Functional API or by subclassing the keras.Model class. However, not all models require dynamic behavior, as static models offer better performance and are easier to optimize."
