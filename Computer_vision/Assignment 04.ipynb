    "### 1. What is the concept of cyclical momentum?\n",
    "Cyclical momentum is a technique used in optimization algorithms, where the momentum parameter is cycled between two values. This helps in faster convergence to the minima by avoiding oscillations and overshoots. By using cyclical momentum, the model can jump out of a local minima and explore other regions of the loss surface."

    "### 4. In color dim, what does \"poor teaching\" look like? What is the reason for this?\n",
    "Poor teaching in color dim looks like a lack of distinction between different colors. This can happen when the model is not able to learn the complex patterns in the dataset, leading to poor generalization. This can be caused by several factors such as insufficient training data, overfitting, or inadequate model architecture."

    "Batch normalization layers help models generalize better by reducing the internal covariate shift. This means that the mean and variance of the activations are normalized, which helps to reduce the sensitivity of the model to changes in the input distribution. This improves the stability of the model and allows for faster convergence during training."

    "MAX POOLING and AVERAGE POOLING are two types of pooling layers used in CNNs. MAX POOLING returns the maximum value in a pool of values, while AVERAGE POOLING returns the average value. MAX POOLING is commonly used to extract features that are invariant to small changes in the input, while AVERAGE POOLING is used to reduce the dimensionality of the input."

    "We end up with Completely CONNECTED LAYERS to perform the final classification step by mapping the output of the last convolutional or pooling layer to a vector of class probabilities. The output of these layers is passed through a softmax activation function to obtain the final class probabilities."

    "The formulas used to measure the parameters depend on the type of layer and activation function used. For example, the parameters of a fully connected layer can be measured using the dot product between the weight matrix and the input vector, while the parameters of a convolutional layer can be measured using the convolution operation."
