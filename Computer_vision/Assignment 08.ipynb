    "The InceptionNet architecture is also known as the GoogLeNet model. It is a convolutional neural network that aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of object detection and recognition tasks. InceptionNet uses the concept of Inception modules that help in achieving deeper networks with less computational complexity."

    "Neural networks learn features by adjusting their weights during the training process. The weights determine the strength of connections between neurons, which are responsible for processing the input data. The network learns to recognize patterns in the input data by adjusting the weights to minimize the loss function."

    "Fine-tuning a pre-trained model is better than starting from scratch because pre-trained models have already learned to recognize features that are useful for many different problems. Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt these learned features to a new problem, resulting in better performance with less data."
