    "### 1. What do REGION PROPOSALS entail?\n",
    "REGION PROPOSALS is a technique used in object detection to propose candidate object locations in an image. These proposals can be generated using various methods, such as selective search or edge boxes, and are used as input to object detection models for further refinement and classification."

    "### 2. What do you mean by NON-MAXIMUM SUPPRESSION? (NMS)\n",
    "NON-MAXIMUM SUPPRESSION (NMS) is a post-processing step in object detection that filters out overlapping object detections by selecting only the highest scoring detection and suppressing others that have a high degree of overlap with it."

    "Frames per second (FPS) is a measure of how many frames an object detection model can process per second. It is an important metric for real-time applications, such as autonomous driving or video surveillance."

    "The R-CNN model has four main components: (1) region proposal, which generates candidate object locations, (2) feature extraction, which extracts features from each candidate region, (3) object classification, which uses the extracted features to classify each region as an object or background, and (4) object localization, which refines the bounding box coordinates of each detected object."

    "The Localization Module is a component of the R-CNN model that refines the bounding box coordinates of each detected object by predicting offsets from the original bounding box coordinates generated by the region proposal algorithm."

    "Some disadvantages of the R-CNN model include its high computational and memory requirements, as well as its slow processing speed. Additionally, it requires training separate models for object detection and object classification, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive."
