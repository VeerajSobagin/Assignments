    "### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Def statements are used to define a function in Python with a specific name and a set of parameters that define its inputs. Lambda expressions, on the other hand, are used to create anonymous functions that can be passed around as arguments or returned from other functions. In other words, lambda expressions are a shorthand way to define small, one-off functions without giving them a specific name."

    "The primary benefit of using a lambda function is its conciseness and readability. Lambda functions can be defined in a single line, which makes them useful for tasks such as sorting and filtering lists. They are also useful for passing simple functions as arguments to other functions, which can reduce the amount of code needed to perform a specific task."

    "\n",
    ". `map` takes a function and an iterable as input and applies the function to each element in the iterable, returning a new iterable containing the results. For example, `map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3])` would return `[1, 4, 9]`.\n",
    "\n",
    ". `filter` takes a function and an iterable as input and applies the function to each element in the iterable, returning a new iterable containing only the elements for which the function returns True. For example, `filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])` would return `[2, 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    ". `reduce` takes a function and an iterable as input and applies the function cumulatively to the elements of the iterable, returning a single value. For example, `reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4])` would return `10` (which is equivalent to `(1+2+3+4)`)."

    "A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. It is a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems. A recursive function typically consists of two parts: a base case that specifies when the function should stop calling itself, and a recursive case that breaks down the problem into smaller sub-problems.\n",
