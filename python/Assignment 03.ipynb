    "In a Python program, there is only one global scope, which is accessible from any part of the code. However, there can be any number of local scopes created within a function when it's called. Each function call creates a new local scope, which is destroyed when the function returns."

    "When a function call returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten. The values of those variables are no longer accessible outside the function. If the same variable name is used in the global scope, it will have its original value before the function call."

    "A return value is the output or result of a function that is returned to the caller of the function when the function is executed. It is possible to have a return value in an expression, as a function can be used within an expression and its return value can be used to perform some operation."
