    "To get the RGBA value of an image using Pillow module, you can use the `getpixel()` method on the Image object. For example, `image.getpixel((x, y))` will return a tuple of RGBA values at the specified location (x, y) in the image."

    "A box tuple is a tuple of four integers representing a rectangular region in an image. The tuple is of the form (left, upper, right, lower), where left and upper are the coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangular region, and right and lower are the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the region. This tuple can be used to crop, paste, or resize a rectangular region in an image."

    "To get an Image object for a 100x100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter, you can use the `crop()` method. For example, `image.crop((0, 0, 50, 50))` will crop the image from the top-left corner to halfway across and halfway down the image."

    "ImageDraw objects have drawing methods, such as `point()`, `line()`, `rectangle()`, `ellipse()`, etc. To get an ImageDraw object, you can use the `ImageDraw.Draw()` function and pass in an Image object. For example, `draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)` will create an ImageDraw object for the image."
