    "An assignment operator like += is not only for show, it can lead to faster results at runtime in certain situations. For mutable objects like lists, using += to append elements is generally faster than using the + operator to concatenate two lists because the former modifies the original list in place, while the latter creates a new list."

    "In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and assigned to variables.

A wrapped feature is the original function being wrapped. A decorator is a special kind of wrapper that uses the @ symbol and is applied directly to the function being decorated."

    "One benefit of generators is that they allow you to generate and process large sequences of values without creating them all in memory at once. This can save memory and increase performance, especially when dealing with large data sets or infinite sequences. Additionally, generators can be composed and pipelined together to create complex data processing pipelines with minimal memory overhead."
