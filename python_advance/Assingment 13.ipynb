    "### Q1. Can you create a programme or function that employs both positive and negative indexing? Is there any repercussion if you do so?\n",
    "Yes, you can use both positive and negative indexing in a program or function. Positive indexing refers to counting from the beginning of the list, while negative indexing refers to counting from the end of the list. The only repercussion of using negative indexing is that it may be slightly more confusing to read and understand, especially for those who are not familiar with it."

    "If you want the function to be able to change the values of the list, you should avoid assigning a new value to the list parameter within the function. Instead, you should modify the values of the list in place. This is because assigning a new value to the parameter will create a new list object and the original list object will not be modified."

    "### Q8. Why is it necessary to use either list comprehension or a loop to create arbitrarily large matrices?\n",
    "It is necessary to use either list comprehension or a loop to create arbitrarily large matrices because Python does not provide a built-in way to create matrices of a specified size. Lists can be used to represent matrices, but they must be created and populated manually. List comprehension and loops are efficient ways to create large matrices because they can be used to create a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the matrix."
