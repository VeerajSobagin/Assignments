    "The two operator overloading methods manage printing in the following contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "`__str__`: Used to return a string representation of an object, usually for display purposes.\n",
    "`__repr__`: Used to return an unambiguous string representation of an object, typically used for debugging purposes."

    "### Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?\n",
    "In a Python class, you can intercept slice operations by implementing the `__getitem__` method. This method is called when an object is indexed with the `[]` notation. The `__getitem__` method takes a slice object as an argument and returns the corresponding slice of the object."

    "### Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?\n",
    "In a Python class, you can capture in-place addition by implementing the `__iadd__` method. This method is called when the `+=` operator is used on an object. It should modify the object in place and return the modified object."

    "### Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "Operator overloading should be used when it makes sense to provide a more intuitive or natural syntax for working with objects of a particular class. For example, implementing the `+` operator for a custom class that represents a mathematical vector can make it easier and more natural to perform vector addition. However, overloading operators should not be overused or abused, as it can make code harder to read and understand. It is important to follow the principle of least astonishment, which means that the behavior of a class should not surprise the user."
