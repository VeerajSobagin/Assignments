    "### Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "Class-based exceptions that have been raised are matched to handlers based on their type hierarchy. When an exception is raised, Python searches for the closest handler that can handle the exception by looking at the handler's except clause. If the exception type matches the type of the raised exception or is a superclass of the raised exception, the handler is considered a match and its associated code is executed."

    "### Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "String-based exceptions are no longer used in Python because they are not as flexible or expressive as class-based exceptions. With string-based exceptions, you can only match exceptions based on their string representation, which can be error-prone and not very informative. Class-based exceptions provide a more structured and extensible way of defining and handling exceptions. They also allow for more precise exception handling based on the type hierarchy of the exception classes."
