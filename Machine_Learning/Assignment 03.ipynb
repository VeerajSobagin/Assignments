    "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that involves building models capable of learning from data, without being explicitly programmed. It works by feeding large amounts of data into an algorithm that learns patterns and relationships within the data, and then applies that learning to new data to make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "Two examples of machine learning applications in the business world are fraud detection and recommendation systems. \n",
    "Some ethical concerns that machine learning applications could raise include privacy violations, bias and discrimination, and lack of transparency and accountability in decision-making."
