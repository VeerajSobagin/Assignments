    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It works by using algorithms to find patterns and insights in data, which can then be used to make predictions or take actions. The key responsibilities of machine learning include data preparation, model training, model evaluation, and deployment."

For example, predicting housing prices based on features such as location, square footage, and number of bedrooms. Regression algorithms use statistical methods to find the best-fit line or curve that minimizes the error between predicted and actual output values. Real-world problems solved using regression include predicting stock prices and estimating crop yields."
