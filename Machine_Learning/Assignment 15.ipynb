In data preparation, the data is cleaned and preprocessed. In feature extraction and selection, relevant features are identified and extracted from the data. In model training, the algorithm is trained on the labeled data. In model evaluation, the performance of the model is assessed using various metrics.

The root node represents the entire population or sample, while internal nodes correspond to the features or attributes of the input. Decision nodes contain binary decisions or questions, and leaf nodes indicate the output or class label."

In decision tree learning, inductive bias comes from the structure of the tree and the splitting criteria used to build it. To prevent overfitting, we can use techniques such as pruning, setting a minimum number of samples required to split, and using regularization methods."
